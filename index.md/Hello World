### CPSC 120

* Lab 10
	Lab 10 part 2 was one of my favorites because I really enjoy the logic of traversing through lists. In my computer science class in high school I did a lot of traversals and revisiting that skill was a nice refresher for me and it felt good to read the directions for the lab and immediately knew what to do. Even though the code was not that long it was fun to include elements of modular programming.

* Lab 8
	Lab 8 part 1 was really enjoyable to work on because of the problem solving skills we had to use. There were many ways to approach the problem in this lab, but we could use the begin and end function to easily find out if the word was a palindrome or not. In this lab we also got to work with files which was really interesting

* Lab 7
	Lab 7 part 2 was challenging because I had never played Blackjack, but once I knew how it worked it was really fun. I found it really enjoyable to try and figure out how to calculate the scores and how to assign different cards their respective values. Using functions and conditionals to accomplish this was a good way to test the skills we had learned.
